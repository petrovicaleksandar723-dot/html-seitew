## Full Automation Flow

### Phase 1: Generate the Character Image

#### Step 1.1: Navigate to image generation

```
browser_navigate → url: "https://higgsfield.ai/image/soul-v2"
```

Wait for page load, take a snapshot.

#### Step 1.2: Enter the image prompt

Find the textbox (Playwright ID: `hf:tour-image-prompt`, placeholder: "Describe the scene you imagine"):

```
browser_click → ref: <textbox_ref>, element: "Image prompt textbox"
browser_type → ref: <textbox_ref>, text: "<character image prompt>"
```

If the user hasn't provided an image prompt, use `/ugc-hot-girl` to generate one first.

#### Step 1.3: Generate the image

Find the Generate button (shows "Generate XXXX free gens left"):

**ASK USER FOR CONFIRMATION** — this uses credits/free generations.

```
browser_click → ref: <generate_button_ref>, element: "Generate button"
```

#### Step 1.4: Wait for generation

```
browser_wait_for → time: 20
```

Take a screenshot. Verify the new image appears as the **first item** in the History grid. Confirm by checking the first grid element's innerHTML contains an `<img>` tag with a fresh asset URL.

---

### Phase 2: Create the Video from the Generated Image

#### Step 2.1: Navigate to Seedance 2.0 video page

```
browser_navigate → url: "https://higgsfield.ai/create/video?model=seedance_2_0"
```

Wait for page load, take a snapshot. Confirm "Seedance 2.0" appears in the Model button.

#### Step 2.2: Open the upload media dialog

Find the upload area — look for `generic [cursor=pointer]` containing:
- `paragraph: Upload media`
- `paragraph: Image, Video or Audio`

```
browser_click → ref: <upload_area_ref>, element: "Upload media area"
```

This opens a **dialog** with tabs: Uploads, Image Generations, Video Generations, Elements, Liked.

#### Step 2.3: Switch to Image Generations tab

```
browser_click → ref: <image_gen_tab_ref>, element: "Image Generations tab"
```

Look for `button "Image Generations"` in the dialog's tab bar.

#### Step 2.4: Select the generated image

The most recently generated image is the **first item** in the grid.

It initially appears as a `button "Check eligibility"`. Click it:

```
browser_click → ref: <first_image_ref>, element: "First image (most recent generation)"
```

After clicking, the button transforms into a `generic [cursor=pointer]` with an image preview and a green checkmark — meaning it's selected and eligible.

**Important**: The first "Check eligibility" button in the list is always the most recent image. After clicking, its ref disappears from the snapshot and is replaced by a new generic element.

#### Step 2.5: Close the dialog

```
browser_press_key → key: "Escape"
```

Take a snapshot. Verify:
- The upload area **no longer shows** "Upload media" text
- Instead it shows a `generic [cursor=pointer]` with nested image elements (48px thumbnails)
- The old `paragraph: Upload media` and `paragraph: Image, Video or Audio` are gone

#### Step 2.6: Clear any existing prompt

The video page uses a **Lexical rich text editor** (contenteditable div), NOT a standard textbox. To clear it:

```
browser_evaluate → function: "() => { const el = document.querySelector('[data-lexical-editor]'); el.focus(); el.click(); }"
browser_press_key → key: "Control+a"
browser_press_key → key: "Backspace"
```

Take a snapshot. The textbox should now show the placeholder: "Describe your scene in detail. Use @ to reference assets"

#### Step 2.7: Enter the UGC video prompt

After clearing, take a snapshot to get the fresh textbox ref. Then type **slowly** (required for the Lexical editor):

```
browser_type → ref: <textbox_ref>, text: "<UGC video prompt>", slowly: true
```

**UGC Video Prompt Templates** (pick based on style):

**Testimonial / Talking Head:**
```
The woman from @image1 is talking directly to camera with natural hand gestures, warm golden hour lighting, casual authentic vibe. She speaks enthusiastically, leaning in slightly for emphasis. Soft bokeh background, shallow depth of field. Natural skin texture, realistic lip movement, TikTok UGC testimonial style. Smooth handheld camera, 24fps.
```

**Product Showcase:**
```
The woman from @image1 holds up a product toward the camera, turning it to show different angles. Excited genuine expression, eyes wide. Ring light illumination, clean background. She points at the product features, nodding enthusiastically. Close-up selfie framing, iPhone-quality video, authentic UGC feel.
```

**Reaction / Unboxing:**
```
The woman from @image1 opens a package with excited anticipation, pulling out a product and reacting with genuine delight. Surprised expression, mouth open, then breaking into a wide smile. Natural bedroom lighting, casual setting. Handheld camera feel, authentic unboxing energy, TikTok style.
```

**Before/After:**
```
The woman from @image1 starts looking skeptical, touching her face doubtfully. Then she applies a product, and her expression transforms to amazement, touching her skin in disbelief. Soft ring light, bathroom mirror setting. Split-feel transformation moment, genuine reaction, UGC testimonial.
```

**Lifestyle / Day-in-the-Life:**
```
The woman from @image1 walks through a bright modern space, casually interacting with a product as part of her routine. Natural morning light, relaxed movement, authentic candid energy. Camera follows with gentle tracking, shallow depth of field. Aspirational but relatable lifestyle content.
```

#### Step 2.8: Configure video settings (optional)

Default settings work well for most UGC:
- **Duration**: 8s (good for short-form)
- **Ratio**: Auto (or 9:16 for TikTok/Reels)
- **Resolution**: 720p

To change ratio for TikTok vertical:
```
browser_click → ref: <ratio_button_ref>, element: "Ratio selector"
```
Then select "9:16" from the dropdown.

#### Step 2.9: Generate the video

Take a screenshot showing the final form state.

**ASK USER FOR CONFIRMATION** — video generation costs more credits than images.

The Generate button shows credit cost (e.g., "Generate 30 20"):

```
browser_click → ref: <generate_button_ref>, element: "Generate video button"
```

#### Step 2.10: Monitor generation

After clicking Generate:
1. The video enters the generation queue
2. Check the History tab for progress
3. Periodically take screenshots to show status
4. Seedance 2.0 videos typically take 1-3 minutes

## Error Handling

- **Not logged in**: Ask user to log in (`! open https://higgsfield.ai`)
- **Image prompt bar missing**: Refresh the page — this is an intermittent platform bug
- **"Check eligibility" doesn't transform**: The image may not be compatible with Seedance 2.0. Try a different image or re-generate
- **Lexical editor won't clear**: Try triple-clicking to select all, then Backspace. Or use `browser_evaluate` to clear innerHTML
- **Dialog won't close on Escape**: Click outside the dialog area
- **Insufficient credits**: Warn the user before generating. Video costs more than images
- **Stale refs**: Always take a fresh snapshot before each interaction. Refs change after any page state change
