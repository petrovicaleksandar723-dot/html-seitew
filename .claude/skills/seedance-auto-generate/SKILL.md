## Available Sub-Skills (Prompt Generators)

This auto-generate skill is the **automation engine**. To craft the best possible prompt for your video, **first invoke the matching style sub-skill** before running this automation. Each sub-skill turns Claude into a specialized prompt engineer for that video style — generating large, detailed, paste-ready prompts with powerful **2-second hooks** that stop the scroll.

### How to Use Sub-Skills

1. **Pick the sub-skill** that matches your video style from the table below
2. **Invoke it** with `/01-cinematic`, `/07-ecommerce-ad`, `/15-real-estate`, etc.
3. The sub-skill generates a **production-grade Seedance 2.0 prompt** (15-25 lines, with timeline, camera, lighting, sound, and 2-second hook)
4. Then invoke `/seedance-auto-generate` to **automatically submit** the prompt + image to Higgsfield

## Automation Flow

Follow these steps exactly using Playwright MCP tools. Load each tool with `ToolSearch` before first use.

### Step 0: Prepare the image

If the image is outside the project directory (e.g. in `C:\Users\User\Downloads\`), copy it into the project root first:

```
cp "<source_path>" "C:/Users/User/higgz/<filename>"
```

The Playwright file upload tool only allows files within the project root.

### Step 1: Navigate to Seedance 2.0 creation page

```
browser_navigate → url: "https://higgsfield.ai/create/video?model=seedance_2_0"
```

The `?model=seedance_2_0` query parameter pre-selects the Seedance 2.0 model automatically.

Wait for the page to load, then take a snapshot to confirm:
- The page title contains "Create AI Videos"
- The Model button shows "Seedance 2.0"

If a cookie consent dialog appears, close it by clicking the "Close" button (x).

### Step 2: Open the upload dialog

Take a snapshot and find the upload area. It contains text like "Upload media" and "Image, Video or Audio". Click the upload area element.

This opens a **dialog** with tabs: "Uploads", "Image Generations", "Video Generations", "Elements", "Liked".

### Step 3: Trigger the file chooser

Inside the dialog, find and click the **"Upload media"** button (the first clickable item in the dialog grid — it has an upload icon and text "Upload media" with subtext "Protected content is not allowed").

This triggers a **file chooser** modal. The tool result will say: `[File chooser]: can be handled by browser_file_upload`

### Step 4: Upload the image file

```
browser_file_upload → paths: ["C:\\Users\\User\\higgz\\<filename>"]
```

Use the absolute Windows path with double backslashes. The file must be within the Playwright allowed roots (`C:\Users\User\higgz`).

### Step 5: Wait for upload to process

```
browser_wait_for → time: 5
```

Wait 5 seconds for the image to upload and appear in the asset grid.

### Step 6: Select the uploaded image

Take a snapshot of the dialog. The **newly uploaded image** appears as the **first item after the "Upload media" button** in the grid. It will be a `generic [cursor=pointer]` element. Click it.

**Important**: The newly uploaded image is always the first grid item right after the upload button. Look for the element immediately following the upload button in the dialog's grid.

### Step 7: Close the dialog

```
browser_press_key → key: "Escape"
```

The dialog closes. The image is now loaded into the form — the upload area is replaced by an image preview.

### Step 8: Verify image is loaded

Take a snapshot. Confirm:
- The upload area now shows an image preview (a `figure` with `img "media is loading"` or similar)
- The prompt textbox is visible (labeled "Prompt" with placeholder "Describe your scene in detail")
- The Model still shows "Seedance 2.0"

### Step 9: Enter the prompt

Click the prompt textbox, then type the prompt:

```
browser_click → ref: <textbox_ref>, element: "Prompt textbox"
browser_type → ref: <textbox_ref>, text: "<the video prompt>"
```

The prompt should be crafted by one of the 15 sub-skills listed above. If the user hasn't specified a style, pick the best-matching sub-skill and use it to generate the prompt first.

### Step 10: Adjust settings (optional)

If the user wants non-default settings:

- **Duration**: Click the "Duration" button, then select the desired option
- **Ratio**: Click the "Auto Ratio" button, then select (16:9, 9:16, 1:1)
- **Resolution**: Click the "720p Resolution" button, then select (720p, 1080p)

### Step 11: Generate

Take a screenshot to show the user the final form state before generating.

**ASK THE USER FOR CONFIRMATION** before clicking Generate — this costs credits.

```
browser_click → ref: <generate_button_ref>, element: "Generate button"
```

The Generate button shows the credit cost (e.g., "Generate 48 32"). After clicking, the video enters the generation queue.

### Step 12: Monitor generation

After clicking Generate:
1. The page may redirect or show a progress indicator
2. Click the "History" tab to see generation status
3. Wait and periodically check until the video is ready
4. Once complete, the video will appear in the History tab

## Key Element Patterns (for snapshot navigation)

These are the typical element patterns found on the page. Refs change between sessions — always take a fresh snapshot before interacting.

| Element | How to find it |
|---|---|
| Upload area | `generic [cursor=pointer]` containing text "Upload media" and "Image, Video or Audio" |
| Upload button in dialog | First item in `dialog > generic > generic` grid, contains "Upload media" text |
| Newly uploaded image | First `generic [cursor=pointer]` after the upload button in dialog grid |
| Prompt textbox | `textbox` inside `generic` with label "Prompt" |
| Model button | `button "Model"` containing "Seedance 2.0" |
| Duration button | `button "Duration"` |
| Ratio button | `button "Auto Ratio"` or `button "16:9 Ratio"` |
| Resolution button | `button "720p Resolution"` |
| Generate button | `button "Generate ..."` with credit cost numbers |

## Error Handling

- **Not logged in**: If the page shows a login prompt instead of the creation form, ask the user to log in manually (`! open https://higgsfield.ai` in the CLI)
- **File chooser not triggered**: Retry clicking the upload media button; sometimes a second click is needed
- **Image not appearing in grid**: Wait longer (up to 10s) and re-snapshot
- **Dialog won't close**: Try clicking outside the dialog area, or press Escape again
- **Insufficient credits**: The Generate button shows the cost — warn the user before clicking
